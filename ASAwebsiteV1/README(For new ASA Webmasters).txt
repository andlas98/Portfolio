To future Webmasters,
	Whether you plan on adding small, simple edits or completely overhauling the website, keep these tenets in mind.
	
	-Read ALL the previous code before you change/edit it: Code that you edit in one page might mess with content in another page. Try to be careful!
	- Talk to your E-Board as you work: inform them on updates to the site, no matter how small. Get as much feedback from them as possible!
	- Keep it simple, stupid: Don't go crazy adding bits and pieces to the site. Start small, work on the essentials (think about whether those essentials are REALLY essential). You want it to look good AND be functional.
	- If you're stuck, look it up: Not too savvy in HTML or CSS? Trying to add something to the site, but it's not looking the way you want it? A mix of both? Don't worry, I was in your shoes while creating this site. I went from only knowing how to print out sentences and images to creating the first version of the website! My favorite online resources were W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/) and TutorialsPoint (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/). If you know little to no HTML (coughcoughmecoughcough), Code the Web( https://codetheweb.blog/learn/html/) can be a godsend. Stack Overflow is also a good site to check out, as well.
	- Don't put 100% of your efforts on the site: I know this sounds redundant, but hear me out: You may be webmaster, but there will be other assignments/duties assigned to you by the VP or the President. And you're a student in RPI, which means mountains of coursework. Make sure you give them attention as well!
	
	All in all, stay calm and have fun! You might struggle a lot, or none at all; as long if you can create something you and the ASA community can enjoy, then you'll succeed.
	
Peace,
