		<p>Hey there!<br>Missed us?<br>Managed to show up at some ASA events?<br>Yes? <br>No?<br>Maybe so?<br>
		Regardless, we still have more events in store for all of you! The closest one is the <span style="color:rgb(200, 0, 0)" ><u>International Festival</u></span>, happening this Saturday, October 20th, 2018 in the Rensselaer Union. Come in, meet our executive board, and see performances from us and other multicultural orgs! And dont be afraid to drop a Happy Birthday to your favorite Webmaster (me!), as it falls on the same day!</p>
		<p>Finally, some good/bad news: Getting the bad out of the way, there will be <span style="color:rgb(200, 0, 0)" ><u>no GBM this week (10/14 - 10/20)</u></span>. I swear, I shed a tear just thinking about it. Don't fret, though! We will be having another GBM next week, involving a club you may (or may not) know: the <span style="color:rgb(200, 0, 0)" ><u>Muslim Students Association</u></span>! With such an interesting blend of cultures and ideas, history and art, thoughts and feelings...you can DEFINITELY expect some food there : ).<br>Stay tuned for more details!</p>
